== Use cases

Common use cases that can be address with this architecture are:

- Build, train and deploy machine learning model using Red Hat OpenShift AI.
- Use S3 backend storage for storing the model.
- Create and run Data Science pipelines in Openshift. 
- Consume the model via REST endpoint through a python application deployed in OpenShift.
