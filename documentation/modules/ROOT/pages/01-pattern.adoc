== The story behind this solution pattern

Artificial Intelligence:
Turn an organizationâ€™s data into a valuable business asset and a competitive advantage. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies employ data to deliver business insight, automate tasks, and advance system capabilities. These technologies can help an organization transform all aspects of their business to achieve measurable business outcomes like improving customer satisfaction and becoming more competitive.

Red Hat OpenShift Data Science is an open source machine learning (ML) platform for the hybrid cloud. By providing a fully supported environment to establish MLOps best practices, data scientists and developers can rapidly train, deploy and monitor ML workloads and models on-premise and in the public cloud.

Red Hat OpenShift AI is an AI-focused portfolio that provides tools across the full lifecycle of AI/ML experiments and models and includes Red Hat OpenShift Data Science.

= Platform for running AI workloads:

Red Hat OpenShift AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that provides tools to rapidly develop, train, serve, and monitor machine learning models on site, in the public cloud, or at the edge.

OpenShift AI[https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-ai/overview^] gives data scientists and developers a powerful AI/ML platform for building AI-enabled applications. Data scientists and developers can collaborate to move from experiment to production in a consistent environment quickly.


== The Solution

This solution pattern demonstrates how we can build, train and deploy machine learning model using Red Hat OpenShift AI. We will consume the model via REST endpoint through a python application deployed in OpenShift.
